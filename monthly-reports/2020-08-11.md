  - Develop or customize software tools to facilitate use of the harmonized data model and terminologies by CRDC nodes and CDA.
- __CCDH project goal__: 
  - Create development plan for Pilot Metadata Mapping and Transformation tools
- __Progress over the last month__:
  - Exploration/testing of available tools, and creation of workflow, to apply to mapping of IDC data to standardized vocabularies. https://github.com/cancerDHC/tools/issues/4  
    - Both CEDAR and Ptolemy reviewed; progress report on Ptolemy to be presented at group meeting tomorrow.
      - Source licensing issues re: Ptolemy.
There may be some room for negotiation. We‚Äôll need to finalize the evaluation to see what we can do. 
We improved GitHub organization with regard to Tools repository issues ( üéâ )  and milestones. Still room for improvement on more detailed issues.
Status (e.g. against a timeline):
Q3 work scheduled: https://github.com/cancerDHC/tools/milestone/2 
Next steps/work for the upcoming month in context of workstream or cross-cutting plans:
Continue documenting longer term plans in GitHub milestones.
Better progress on pilot development plan.
Assess needs of tools workstream ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù.
Focus on IDC workflow needs/configuration as an experiment to reveal tools requirements.
Will this also include the 2 sets of data that will be used for testing? DICOM? - 
A/- Yes. 

Ontology and Terminology Ecosystem WS - Each group has 7 minutes to present this update.
CRDC objectives (for the activity):
Develop terminology services to support interoperability across the CRDC ecosystem.
CCDH project goals:
Develop terminology services to support data annotation, data harmonization workflows, and user queries.
Collect requirements for evolution of NCIt, EVS, and caDSR 
Deliver terminological content to nodes and applications, including CDA
Best practices for terminological use and development
Progress over last month:
Terminology meeting on 08/04/20. Notes here.
Working on CRDC Value Set Catalog.
Status (e.g. against a timeline): 
On target to finalize by end of Q3:
https://github.com/cancerDHC/Terminology/milestone/1
On target to finalize by end of Phase II:
https://github.com/cancerDHC/Terminology/milestone/2
Next steps/work for the upcoming month in context of workstream or cross-cutting plans
Assemble existing value sets from node data dictionaries into tabular format
https://github.com/cancerDHC/Terminology/issues/8
Representing value sets in FHIR service (ongoing)
https://github.com/cancerDHC/Terminology/issues/9

Data Model Harmonization WS - Each group has 7 minutes to present this update.
CRDC objectives (for the activity)
Develop a harmonized model that enables cross-node querying and aggregation of disparate data from CRDC nodes and resources
CCDH project goal 
Continue to evolve the CDM into the CRDC-H prototype model
Progress over the last month
Discussed and documented processes, tasks, separation of duties, and staffing related to value set harmonization which will be a critical next step in evolving the CDM into an implementable model
Completed initial mapping of outstanding biospecimen and administrative entities and properties to BRIDG with assistance from Wendy https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues/7
Prepared for and conducted the first of our ‚Äòretrospectives‚Äô of DMH Phase 1 work https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues/13
Conducted a review of data model change management procedures across the CRDC as a first step towards defining a process that keeps the CCDH data model artifacts in sync with changes to source models https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues/11
Changed the format of Office Hours to focus on questions/topics submitted in advance by community members rather than an open question and answer format
Status (e.g. against a timeline):
On target for Phase II: https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/milestone/1
Next steps/work for the upcoming month in context of workstream or cross-cutting plans
Conduct additional retrospective sessions to review our work https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues/13
Produce a proposed data model change notification process based on our survey of existing processes, the information we would want to receive from an upstream model, and input from ICDC/CTDC stakeholders https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues/11
Finish the review of modeling language / framework options for CCDH https://github.com/cancerDHC/data-model-harmonization/issues/9
Begin regular cadence of bi-weekly meetings with CDA modelers
